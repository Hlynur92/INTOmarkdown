    I used virtual box to install Linux Mint, I only gave it 512Mb ram so it was very slow but worked for this assignment.

##  2. Uppsetning á vim && git
     
    That was extremly easy, just wrote the commands given in the assignment into terminal
     
##  3. Unnið með Git (1. hluti)
     
    I did the assignment alone but it was easy to change something after a watched a tutorial online.
